  <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Politics at <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>. I study the politics of economic change in established democracies. More specifically, I work on the party politics and electoral consequences of capital ownership, housing financialization, and labor market distortions. I analyze these topics by combining quasi-experimental and experimental designs with formal models.</p>

	      (with Christian Baehr and Fiona Bare).
	      
	      <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('climateexposure');">[Abstract]</a></i>
	      <div id="climateexposure" style="display:none;"><br> The private sector drives much of climate politics, yet companies selectively choose specific issues and tactics for influence. When do firms engage in climate-related politics and what determines the policies they support? In the face of multifaceted potential impacts from climate change, some firms expect increased costs from new regulation and should lobby against such proclimate policies.  Another matter is relative risk. Firms with physical asset vulnerability and those with greater green business opportunity relative to their competitors should lobby in favor of pro-climate regulation. We proxy for exposure to these threats and opportunities by analyzing the amount of discussion paid to physical, regulatory, and technological opportunity aspects of climate change on quarterly earnings call transcripts for more than 2000 public firms between 2002 and 2020. We estimate the effect of variation in climate exposure on the type and level of political behavior used to influence climate policy through lobbying. We find that increased overall exposure to climate change increases the likelihood that firms engage in any climate-related lobbying, and that differences in exposure to physical risks, regulatory costs, and market opportunities explain across- and within-industry variation of political activity.  </div>

		      (With Joanna Bryson).
		
		<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('polarization');">[Abstract]</a></i>
		<div id="polarization" style="display:none;"><br> The causes of polarization and distrust are not well understood, and subject to competing hypotheses. Here we test empirically whether economic precarity is a cause. Precarity is thought to increase both political polarization and distrust due to individual risk aversion. We empirically test predictions of this hypothesis globally at both macro, country and micro, individual levels.  Further, we exploit exogenous variation in European individuals' exposure to Chinese import shocks to establish a causal relation between economic insecurity and decreasing trust. We find that economic insecurity, in the form of income inequality and unemployment at the macro-level, and perceived economic insecurity at the individual level, are associated with increases of affective polarization, and of public distrust. Our work indicates the importance of social safety nets for maintaining social cohesion.
