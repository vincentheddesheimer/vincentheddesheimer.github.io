  <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Politics at <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>. I study political economy with a focus on the political causes and consequences of economic inequality. I employ causal inference methods for observational data and text-as-data/NLP tools for political text.</p>

	      (with Christian Baehr and Fiona Bare).
	      
	      <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('climateexposure');">[Abstract]</a></i>
	      <div id="climateexposure" style="display:none;"><br> When do firms engage in climate politics? In the face of multifaceted potential impacts from climate change, some firms expect increased costs from new regulation and should lobby against proclimate policies. Those with physical asset vulnerability or greater green business opportunity should lobby in favor of such regulation. Another matter is relative risk and competitive advantage, as within industry competition should further motivate lobbying. We proxy for exposure to these threats and opportunities by analyzing the discussion of physical, regulatory, and technological opportunity aspects of climate change in quarterly earnings call transcripts for more than 2000 publicly traded firms between 2002 and 2020. We estimate the effect of variation of climate exposure on climate lobbying instances (extensive margin), expenditure (intensive margin), and targets (specific political entities). We find that firms with greater exposure to climate change, especially in terms of opportunities and regulatory risks, are more likely to engage in lobbying activities. Their climate exposure, both absolute and relative to industry peers, dictates whether they lobby, how much they spend on lobbying, and their choice of government entities to target. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the importance of disaggregating firm-level perceptions of climate impacts to understand patterns in political activity.  </div>

	      <b><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cmfvb/">Economic Insecurity Increases Polarization and Decreases Trust </a></b>
		      (With Joanna Bryson).
		
		<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('polarization');">[Abstract]</a></i>
		<div id="polarization" style="display:none;"><br> The causes of polarization and distrust are not well understood, and subject to competing hypotheses. Here we test empirically whether economic precarity is a cause. Precarity is thought to increase both political polarization and distrust due to individual risk aversion. We empirically test predictions of this hypothesis globally at both macro, country and micro, individual levels.  Further, we exploit exogenous variation in European individuals' exposure to Chinese import shocks to establish a causal relation between economic insecurity and decreasing trust. We find that economic insecurity, in the form of income inequality and unemployment at the macro-level, and perceived economic insecurity at the individual level, are associated with increases of affective polarization, and of public distrust. Our work indicates the importance of social safety nets for maintaining social cohesion.
