  <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Politics at <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>. I study political economy with a focus on the political causes and consequences of economic inequality and insecurity. I employ causal inference methods for observational data and text-as-data/NLP tools for political text.</p>

		      (with Joanna Bryson).
		
		<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('polarization');">[Abstract]</a></i>
		<div id="polarization" style="display:none;"><br> The causes of polarization and distrust are not well understood, and subject to competing hypotheses. Here we test empirically whether economic precarity is a cause. Precarity is thought to increase both political polarization and distrust due to individual risk aversion. We empirically test predictions of this hypothesis globally at both macro, country and micro, individual levels.  Further, we exploit exogenous variation in European individuals' exposure to Chinese import shocks to establish a causal relation between economic insecurity and decreasing trust. We find that economic insecurity, in the form of income inequality and unemployment at the macro-level, and perceived economic insecurity at the individual level, are associated with increases of affective polarization, and of public distrust. Our work indicates the importance of social safety nets for maintaining social cohesion.

	      (with Christian Baehr and Fiona Bare).
	      
	      <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('climateexposure');">[Abstract]</a></i>
	      <div id="climateexposure" style="display:none;"><br> When do firms engage in climate politics? Expected impacts drive political activity. Specifically, we argue that regulatory concerns, business opportunities, and physical risks activate policy preferences and lobbying efforts. We measure firm-level exposure to opportunity, regulatory, and physical aspects of climate change based on discussion in quarterly earnings call transcripts for 11800+ publicly traded firms between 2001 and 2020. We estimate the effect of climate exposure on climate lobbying instances (extensive margin), expenditure (intensive margin), and targets (political entities). We find that more exposed companies, especially in terms of opportunities and regulation, are more likely to lobby. The type of climate exposure, both absolute and relative to industry peers, dictates whether firms lobby, how much they spend on lobbying, and their choice of government target. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the importance of disaggregating firm-level perceptions of climate impacts to understand patterns in political activity. </div>

	      <b><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/876dr">The Energy Transition and Political Polarization Along Occupational Lines</a></b>
	      (with Hanno Hilbig and Erik Voeten).
	      
	      <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('energytransition');">[Abstract]</a></i>
	      <div id="energytransition" style="display:none;"><br> The green transition creates economic winners and losers. To what extent has the energy transition resulted in political polarization along occupational lines? We examine this question in the context of Germany, a country that has adopted some of the most far-reaching energy transition policies and that also has substantial employment in heavy emissions occupations. The far-right AfD party started campaigning as the only party opposing energy transition policies in 2016. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that, after the 2013 election, AfD support increased in counties with larger shares of employment in polluting occupations. We then use individual-level panel data to show that since 2016, individuals in polluting occupations have become significantly more likely to identify with the far-right. We further demonstrate that these findings are not due to simultaneous political changes, most notably (i) differential activation of xenophobia after 2015 and (ii) losses in manufacturing employment. This suggests that far-right parties have benefited from concerns over present and future energy transition policies. </div>

	      <b><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6h8cq">Place-Based Policies, Local Responses, and Electoral Behavior</a></b>
	      (with Hanno Hilbig and Andreas Wiedemann).
	      
	      <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('energytransition');">[Abstract]</a></i>
	      <div id="grw" style="display:none;"><br> Place-based  economic  policies  are  increasingly  seen  as  instruments  to  counter  political  dis-content in economically-depressed regions.  Do regional investment subsidies affect electoralbehavior?  We evaluate this question in the context of Germany’s largest regional investmentprogram. Our identification strategy leverages a 2014 subsidy rate cut for manufacturing firmsthat – due to EU rules – was exogenous to local economic trends.  The subsidy cut reducedvoting for the far-right AfD and increased support for the incumbent Christian Democrats. Wethen demonstrate that subsidy cuts trigger two counterreactions:  local firms invest more inhuman capital and local governments invest more in infrastructure and public goods.  We ar-gue that these dynamics signal to voters that local governments are responsive and care abouttheir constituents, undermining populist appeals.  Our findings suggest that political conse-quences of place-based policies – and austerity more broadly – cannot be understood withoutconsidering counteractions by local firms and governments.</div>
