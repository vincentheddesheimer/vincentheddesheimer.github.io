				<b>Building Coalitions: The Partisan Politics of Housing Supply</b>
				<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('housing');">[Description]</a></i>
			<div id="housing" style="display:none;"><br> My dissertation investigates the political causes and
				consequences of housing supply in advanced democracies, with a focus on the role of local politicians.
				While housing affordability has become a central challenge globally, political science has paid limited
				attention to how local politicians' incentives shape housing outcomes. My research explores when and how
				local elected officials permit more housing, and under what conditions this is shaped by electoral
				incentives.
				Using original data on housing permits and construction, municipal election outcomes, local budgets, and
				interviews with politicians in Germany, I show that politicians' incentives help explain variation in
				the amount, type (e.g., single- vs. multi-family), ownership structure (public vs. private), and
				location (urban vs. peripheral) of housing supply.
				In addition to observational analyses, I field original surveys of both voters and local politicians to
				probe the micro-foundations of my theory. Finally, I study the downstream political and socio-economic
				effects of increased housing supply in Germany and the United States.
				The dissertation contributes to debates on political representation, local governance, and the limits of
				national policymaking in addressing structural challenges like housing. It also revisits foundational
				claims about the (in)significance of local politics for economic outcomes, arguing that local political
				decisions—particularly about land use—are central to understanding the geography of inequality in the
				21st century.

					<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('energytransition');">[Abstract]</a></i>
					<div id="energytransition" style="display:none;"><br> Green transition policies set long-term
						targets to reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants, posing a threat to workers in polluting
						occupations and communities reliant on these occupations. Can far right parties attract voters
						who anticipate losing from the green transition? We explore this in Germany, which has ambitious
						green policies and a large workforce in polluting occupations. The far right AfD started
						campaigning as the only party opposing green transition policies in 2016. Using a
						difference-in-differences design, we show AfD support increased in counties with more polluting
						jobs after this platform change. A panel survey further demonstrates that individuals in these
						occupations also shifted towards the AfD. Probing mechanisms, we find suggestive evidence that
						growing far right support is due to changing perceptions of social stigma and lower status. Our
						results highlight the need for a new research agenda on a backlash against the normative
						dimension of the green transition. </div>

					(with Christian Baehr and Fiona Bare). Conditionally accepted, <b><i> American Journal of Political
							Science</i></b>.

					<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('climateexposure');">[Abstract]</a></i>
					<div id="climateexposure" style="display:none;"><br>When and how do firms engage in climate
						politics? We argue that regulatory concerns, business opportunities, and physical risks activate
						policy preferences and lobbying efforts. We measure firm-level exposure to opportunity,
						regulatory, and physical aspects of climate change based on discussion in quarterly earnings
						call transcripts for 11,705 publicly traded firms between 2001 and 2023. We estimate the effect
						of climate exposure on climate lobbying instances (extensive margin), amount (intensive margin),
						and targets (political entities). We find that more exposed companies, especially in terms of
						opportunities and regulation, are more likely to lobby. The type of climate exposure, both
						absolute and relative to industry peers, dictates whether firms lobby, how much they spend on
						lobbying, and their choice of government target. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the
						importance of disaggregating firm-level perceptions of climate impacts to understand patterns in
						political activity. </div>

						Elections are the key mechanism through which voters hold elected officials accountable. The
						partisan composition of local, state, and federal governments, in turn, shapes policy choices
						and public goods provision. Yet studying representation, government responsiveness, and partisan
						politics across multiple levels of government—especially at the local level—has been difficult
						due to inconsistently reported, incomplete, or insufficiently harmonized election data at small
						geographic scales. This paper introduces GERDA (https://www.german-elections.com/), a panel
						dataset of local, state, and federal election results in Germany at the municipality level
						spanning the past three decades. GERDA includes turnout and vote shares for all major parties
						and resolves challenges arising from municipal boundary changes and joint mail-in voting
						districts, yielding a consistent panel of municipalities in their 2021 boundaries. We also
						provide municipal and county boundary shapefiles to facilitate spatial analyses. Our dataset
						enables new research on partisan politics, policy responsiveness, and political representation
						at fine-grained geographic scales and over time. </div>

					(with Hanno Hilbig and Andreas Wiedemann).

					<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('grw');">[Abstract]</a></i>
					<div id="grw" style="display:none;"><br> Place-based economic policies are increasingly seen as
						instruments to counter political discontent in economically-depressed regions. Do regional
						investment subsidies affect electoral behavior? We evaluate this question in the context of
						Germany's largest regional investment program. Our identification strategy leverages a 2014
						subsidy rate cut for manufacturing firms that - due to EU rules - was exogenous to local
						economic trends. The subsidy cut reduced voting for the far-right AfD and increased support for
						the incumbent Christian Democrats. We then demonstrate that subsidy cuts trigger two
						counterreactions: local firms invest more in human capital and local governments invest more in
						infrastructure and public goods. We argue that these dynamics signal to voters that local
						governments are responsive and care about their constituents, undermining populist appeals. Our
						findings suggest that political consequences of place-based policies - and austerity more
						broadly - cannot be understood without considering counteractions by local firms and
						governments.</div>

					<b>Long-run Political Change after the Great Recession</b>
					(with Hanno Hilbig). (draft available upon request)

					<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('recession');">[Abstract]</a></i>
					<div id="recession" style="display:none;"><br> What are the long-term political consequences of
						economic crises? We assess the enduring impact of the Great Recession on U.S. political
						outcomes. We employ a difference-in-differences approach, leveraging geographic variation in
						unemployment shocks. Contrary to claims that major recessions primarily boost anti-incumbent,
						far-right candidates, we find that counties more severely affected by the recession experienced
						a sustained increase in Democratic vote shares, particularly in Congressional elections. These
						effects persisted for at least 10 years. We demonstrate that these results are unlikely to be
						due to persistent economic decline, demographic changes, shifts in candidate ideology, or fiscal
						compensation spending. Instead, survey evidence suggests that the recession lowered expectations
						for upward mobility, likely increasing support for redistribution and thereby benefiting
						Democratic candidates. Our findings expand the literature by showing that (i) severe economic
						shocks do not necessarily favor right-wing populists, and (ii) major downturns can continue to
						influence electoral outcomes long after direct economic consequences have subsided.

					<b><a href="https://osf.io/x23bj_v2" target="_blank">Economic Insecurity Increases
							Affective
							Polarization and Outgroup-Aversion </a></b>
					(with Joanna Bryson).

					<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('polarization');">[Abstract]</a></i>
					<div id="polarization" style="display:none;"><br> Affective polarization - a deep emotional divide
						between opposing social and political groups - has become a pressing global governance
						challenge, disrupting both democratic processes and policy uptake. While some degree of position
						polarization should be expected in a healthy, multi-party political system, the factors driving
						recent extremes in divisions remain unclear. One candidate factor, economic instability, has
						been frequently linked to rising polarization, but causal evidence to date has been limited.
						Using panel survey data from the Netherlands and a difference-in-differences design, we show
						that economic insecurity significantly increases affective polarization. The effect persists for
						years, with a longer (though slower) expression among men. It is also accompanied by increased
						distrust and social group clustering. Our findings suggest that economic insecurity is a key
						driver of polarization, highlighting the role of labor market stability in shaping political and
						social cohesion.
